# FastMuscleCurves
Matlab scripts of quick to evaluate splines of the various nonlinear muscle curves. The goal of this work is to develope a spline formulation that can be evaluated without numerical iteration, each spline is convex, and has at least a continuous 1st derivative. The most promising set of splines with these properties are quadratic and cubic Bezier curves.
